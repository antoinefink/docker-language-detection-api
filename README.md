# Language detection API

This repository contains a dockerized version of [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/docker-library/elasticsearch) with the [https://github.com/jprante/elasticsearch-langdetect](Language Detect plugin). **The goal is to have a language detection API up and working within a 2 minutes. The precision is over 99% for 53 languages.**

To run it:
```
docker run --name language-detection-api --rm -p 9200:9200 antoinefinkelstein/elasticsearch-langdetect
```

**You're ready to use it!** For example:
```
curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_langdetect?pretty' -d 'This is a test'
{
  "profile" : "/langdetect/",
  "languages" : [ {
    "language" : "en",
    "probability" : 0.9999972283490304
  } ]
}
curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_langdetect?pretty' -d 'Das ist ein Test'
{
  "profile" : "/langdetect/",
  "languages" : [ {
    "language" : "de",
    "probability" : 0.9999985460514316
  } ]
}
curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_langdetect?pretty' -d 'Datt isse ne test'
{
